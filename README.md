🏆 Prerequisites
Before you dive into the course, it's recommended to have:

A basic understanding of programming (for the beginner section).

No prior Python experience is needed! This course will guide you through everything step-by-step.

A Python environment set up on your system (if you're unsure, we'll cover that in the setup section).

🧑‍💻 Course Structure
This course is designed to be hands-on and project-oriented. Each section is broken down into digestible lessons, with a quiz and exercises at the end of each major topic. You’ll also find projects and real-world applications scattered throughout the course.

Lesson Duration: Each lesson should take around 1 to 2 hours.

Project Time: You will spend 5-10 hours on the final project, applying everything you’ve learned.

🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will:

Have a strong foundation in Python.

Be able to build complex Python applications.

Understand data manipulation and analysis using Python.

Know how to build and deploy web applications.

Gain experience with machine learning and data science using Python.

⚙️ Setup Instructions: Google Colab Edition
1. Google Colab Setup 🌐
Instead of setting up Python on your local machine, you can easily use Google Colab, a cloud-based Python environment. To start:

Visit Google Colab.
https://colab.research.google.com/

Sign in with your Google account (if you're not already logged in).

Create a new notebook by selecting File > New Notebook.

Now you're ready to start coding in Python without any installation hassles! 🚀

2. Working with Code in Google Colab 🖥️
In Google Colab, you can write and run Python code inside cells. You can execute the code by simply pressing Shift + Enter or by clicking the play button beside the cell.

3. Saving Your Work 💾
Your work in Google Colab is automatically saved in your Google Drive, so you don't need to worry about losing your progress. To download your notebook for offline use, select File > Download and choose the format you prefer (either .ipynb or .py).
